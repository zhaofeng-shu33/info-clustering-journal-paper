Yes, I have published parts of this submitted manuscript in International Conference on Neural Information Processing 2019.
The conference paper focuses on how to apply graph-based info-clustering to outlier detection problems and propose an improved algorithm for principal
sequence of partition. In this journal manuscript, we have extended the results of graph-based info-clustering for other problems including community
detection, link prediction and clustering analysis. Besides, we have given a solid theoretical analysis for graph-based info-clustering.
